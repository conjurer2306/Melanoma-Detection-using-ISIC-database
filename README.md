# Melanoma-Detection-using-ISIC-database

The ISIC has just released their 2018 challenge. This year the classification challenge changed from focusing on whether or not to biopsy (binary classification) to a full multi-class classification problem including 7 different types of lesions.
The full list of lesion types types to classify in the ISIC dataset. Weâ€™ll be focusing on Melanoma vs. non-Melanoma.
###The desired metric for the ISIC challenge this year is 7-way classification accuracy, not AUC as it has been in previous years.
